# Data Science trainings and practice

This repo contains some introductory scripts for data science that I tried out myself and also gave sessions  on. Note that this is again not complete and retrieved from a participant since the latest was deleted when my system crashed.

Anyhow, a typical session of 6-7 hours used to cover the following in theory and hands-on - 

- Why Data Science and what does it mean
- Some examples like Watson to inspire folks
- Some basic statistics concepts
- Some basic R commands
- Linear and Logistics theory and practice
- Classification and Regression Trees
- Random Forests
- RoC curves
- Basic text analytics
- K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering methods
